Design debates are healthy when the team shares a set of standards. Without them,
opinions become the loudest voice in the room, and that slows the work down.

## Standards create momentum

Clear standards remove ambiguity. They let teams move quickly without losing
craft because the bar is already understood.

## Opinions still matter

Standards are not a replacement for taste. They are the baseline that allows
good taste to compound, not conflict.
